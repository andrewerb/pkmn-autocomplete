This is a Python 2.7 script to pull a list of Pokémon names from pokeapi.co

I needed a list of names to put into a Trie data structure for autofill/automplete functionality. So, I'm fetching Pokémon names.

This info is available pretty much anywhere but weirdly tricky to get in raw form without parsing or sanitizing its source in some way.
